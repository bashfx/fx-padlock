padlock.sh is built via build.sh from ./parts
do not read/edit it directly you must change the part files

you have local commands available
- func (function utility for bash scripts)
  - func ls <src> # list all functions in a file
  - func spy <function> <src> # show the contents of a particular function if exists

- gitsim (can crate a virtual home and project folder for testing)

use the help command to see more indepth apis.
