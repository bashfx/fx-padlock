# Padlock Development TODO

## âœ… **Completed (Latest Session)**

1. âœ… **Master Key Backup System** - Implemented passphrase-wrapped ignition backup
   - Creates encrypted backup during setup
   - `padlock key restore` command for recovery
   - Non-interactive environment detection

2. âœ… **Test Runner Improvements** - Fixed all major issues
   - Uses `$HOME/.cache/tmp` instead of system temp
   - Fixed git directory errors with gitsim compatibility
   - Fixed tar command issues in overdrive mode
   - Added ceremonious presentation with box functions

3. âœ… **Post-commit Checksum Fix** - Resolved lingering artifacts
   - Modified pre-commit hook to include `.locker_checksum` in same commit
   - No more additional commits required after locking

4. âœ… **Repair Command** - Complete recovery system
   - `padlock repair` detects and fixes missing .padlock files
   - Uses manifest and available evidence for reconstruction
   - Handles both repo-specific and global key scenarios

5. âœ… **Interactive Setup** - Added `padlock setup` command
   - Prompts for ignition backup passphrase
   - Creates complete configuration automatically
   - Provides helpful guidance for next steps

6. âœ… **Documentation Updates** - Aligned with implementation
   - Updated README.md with actual features (removed TBD markers)
   - Created comprehensive FEATURES.md with examples
   - All command references now accurate

## ðŸš§ **In Progress**

### **Overdrive Mode Edge Cases**
- Core functionality works but has some variable scoping issues
- Tar timestamp warnings (cosmetic)
- Need to resolve "super_chest: unbound variable" error

## ðŸ“‹ **Future Enhancements**

### **High Priority**
1. **Map Command** - File/folder inclusion system
   - `padlock map <src>` to designate files for secure bundle
   - Uses `padlock.map` manifest for restoration
   - Allows selective inclusion of files outside locker/

2. **Default Code Section** - Add `code_sec` to standard locker structure
   - Complement existing `docs_sec` and `conf_sec`
   - For source code snippets, scripts, etc.

### **Medium Priority**
3. **Enhanced Error Handling** - More robust error recovery
   - Better handling of corrupted repositories
   - Improved diagnostic messages
   - Automatic cleanup of partial states

4. **Team Workflow Improvements** - Better collaboration features
   - Recipient management commands
   - Team member onboarding helpers
   - Access audit trails

### **Low Priority**
5. **Performance Optimizations** - For large repositories
   - Incremental encryption for large lockers
   - Compression options
   - Background processing

6. **Integration Features** - External tool support
   - CI/CD helpers
   - IDE plugins
   - Cloud storage backends

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Session Goals**

1. Fix remaining overdrive mode issues
2. Implement map command functionality
3. Add default `code_sec` directory
4. Enhance error handling and diagnostics

**Note**: This session successfully implemented all the major TODO items from the original list. The padlock system now has robust backup/recovery, intelligent repair capabilities, and comprehensive testing.
