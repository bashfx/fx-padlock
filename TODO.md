# Padlock Development TODO

## âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES (August 2025)

All original TODO items have been successfully implemented:

### 1. âœ… Enhanced `padlock declamp` 
- Removes .padlock, padlock.map, checksums, and local age files
- Removes entries from manifest and stored repo keys
- Cleans up namespace metadata and artifacts directories
- Provides comprehensive cleanup with confirmation prompts

### 2. âœ… Enhanced `padlock map` command
- Stores file name, restore location, and MD5 checksum in padlock.map manifest
- Format: `source_path|destination_path|md5_checksum`
- Supports both files and directories with integrity verification
- Displays checksums in truncated format for readability

### 3. âœ… Map support in `padlock lock` command
- Moves mapped files to `locker/map/` before encryption
- Automatically tars and compresses directories
- Implements `.chest` pattern - moves artifacts to `.chest/` for clean repo
- Updates checksums in manifest after processing

### 3a. âœ… Enhanced `padlock unlock` command  
- Restores mapped files/directories to original locations
- Extracts tar.gz archives back to directories
- Restores padlock.map from encrypted storage
- Handles both old and new (.chest) artifact locations

### 4. âœ… Fixed `.locked` file issue
- Issue was leftover artifact (manually cleaned up)
- Proper state management implemented with .chest pattern

### 5. âœ… Implemented `padlock unmap` command
- Supports individual file removal and `unmap all`
- Interactive selection for duplicate filenames  
- Relative/absolute path resolution with canonical matching
- Only works when repository is unlocked (proper validation)

### 6. âœ… Fixed padlock.map storage location
- Only visible when repository is unlocked
- Stored in encrypted locker during lock, restored during unlock  
- Backed up in .chest for redundancy

### 7. âœ… Implemented `.chest` pattern
- Keeps repository root clean during lock state
- All artifacts (locker.age, checksums, map files) stored in `.chest/`
