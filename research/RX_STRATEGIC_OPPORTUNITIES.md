padlock zk-proof --verify-integrity          # Cryptographic integrity proofs
padlock zk-audit --no-access                 # Audit without data access
padlock zk-share --threshold=3of5             # Distributed key management
```

### Technical Innovation Points
1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify integrity without data access
2. **Threshold Cryptography**: Distributed key management (M-of-N schemes)
3. **Commitment Schemes**: Cryptographic commitment to repository state
4. **Privacy-Preserving Audit**: Compliance without compromising privacy

### Market Differentiation
- **Government Contracts**: Meet strict zero-knowledge requirements
