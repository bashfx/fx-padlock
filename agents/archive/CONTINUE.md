# CONTINUATION - Ignition Key System Pilot

## Status: 80% Complete - Need to Finish Implementation

### What's Been Completed ✅
1. **PILOT.md** - Comprehensive architecture analysis document with 5 approaches
2. **pilot.sh** - Working script with 3 approaches implemented
3. **Branch Created** - Working in `pilot/ignition` branch
4. **Core Testing** - layered_native approach fully tested and working

### Critical Next Steps (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1. Fix Double-Wrapped Approach (BLOCKING)
**Issue**: Currently hanging on age -p interactive prompts
**Solution**: The fake TTY approach needs debugging
```bash
# Current problematic code in pilot.sh around line 94:
script -qec "echo -e '${passphrase}\n${passphrase}' | age -p -o '$inner_encrypted' '$temp_key'" /dev/null
```
**User's Preferred Solution**: "im perfectly ok with fake tty lmao" - use script wrapper

#### 2. Implement 2 Novel Approaches (USER REQUESTED)
**User Command**: "devise two approaches of your own design informed by the web, your own insights, and novel outside of the box concepts"

**Approaches Added to PILOT.md**:
- **Approach 4**: Temporal Chain Delegation (blockchain-style key chains)  
- **Approach 5**: Quantum-Resistant Lattice Proxy (post-quantum threshold schemes)

**Need to Code**: Implement these in pilot.sh (functions missing)

#### 3. Add Proper Benchmarking (USER REQUESTED)
**User Command**: "include a benchmarking scheme...that does 100 commands to start, then can optionally run 1000"
**Current Issue**: Performance table in PILOT.md is placeholder - no real benchmarks run
**Fix Required**: Complete benchmark_approach() function and run real tests

### Current Working State
```bash
# This works perfectly:
./pilot.sh layered_native test
# Result: All tests passed ✅

# This fails (hangs):
./pilot.sh double_wrapped test  
# Result: Hangs on age -p prompt ❌

# Not implemented yet:
./pilot.sh temporal_chain test
./pilot.sh lattice_proxy test
```

### Files Status
- **PILOT.md**: 158 lines, comprehensive analysis ✅
- **pilot.sh**: 710+ lines, 3/5 approaches working ⚠️
- **pilot/ directory**: Test environment setup ✅

### Key Implementation Gaps

#### 1. Missing Functions in pilot.sh:
```bash
temporal_chain_create_ignition()     # Need to implement
temporal_chain_create_distro()       # Need to implement  
temporal_chain_unlock()              # Need to implement
lattice_proxy_create_ignition()      # Need to implement
lattice_proxy_create_distro()        # Need to implement
lattice_proxy_unlock()               # Need to implement
```

#### 2. Fix benchmark_approach() Function:
Currently placeholder, needs real timing and operations

#### 3. Update PILOT.md Performance Table:
Replace placeholder data with real benchmark results

### User's Final Directive
**Direct Quote**: "get as far as you can on this effort without my consultation. Then if you are able to review and test everything make a determination as to which approach is superior. this will be the basis of our implementation for ignition api."

### Success Criteria
1. All 5 approaches implemented and tested
2. Real benchmark data collected (100-1000 operations)
3. Concrete recommendation based on empirical data
4. No hanging/blocking issues in any approach

### Current Recommendation (Preliminary)
**Approach 3 (Layered Native)** is leading because:
- ✅ Fully implemented and tested
- ✅ No interactive prompts (automation-friendly)
- ✅ Pure age encryption (architectural consistency)
- ✅ Simple implementation (16 story points estimated)

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix double_wrapped approach** - debug fake TTY implementation
2. **Implement temporal_chain approach** - blockchain-style key chains  
3. **Implement lattice_proxy approach** - post-quantum threshold schemes
4. **Run real benchmarks** - collect empirical performance data
5. **Update PILOT.md** - replace placeholder data with real results
6. **Make final recommendation** - based on comprehensive testing

### Context Notes
- User is away and expects autonomous completion
- This is "very critical" pilot for production ignition API design
- Branch: `pilot/ignition` (confirmed)
- Full automation mode - no user consultation available
- Expected deliverable: working pilot with data-driven recommendation

### Technical Notes
- age-keygen works fine for key generation
- jq available for JSON processing  
- bc available for timing calculations
- script command available for fake TTY
- All dependencies confirmed working

**PRIORITY**: Complete the remaining 2 novel approaches and fix the hanging issue ASAP.
