# STAKEHOLDER_TEST_001 - Testing Framework Compliance
**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Domain**: Testing & Quality Assurance  
**Priority**: Pre-3.1 integration blockers and quality improvements  
**Scope**: BashFX 3.0 compliance gaps and test framework enhancement requirements

## BashFX Ceremonies Compliance Gaps

The test.sh dispatcher uses basic colors but lacks full BashFX ceremony implementation for progressive state indication with proper STATUS messages (STUB, PASS, FAIL, INVALID)

The test.sh dispatcher does not implement INVALID status handling for tests that cannot run due to environment conditions

The test.sh dispatcher does not provide automation control flags (opt_auto, opt_yes, opt_force, opt_safe, opt_danger) for ceremony control

Individual test files use custom box drawing in harness.sh but do not follow BashFX standard glyphs (✓, ☐, ✗, ∆)

Test files do not provide numbered test progression ceremony (TEST 1, TEST 2, etc.) as required by BashFX § 4.5

Test execution lacks proper whitespace separation between test ceremonies for visual parsing

Test summary ceremonies do not include required timing metrics and environment abnormality reporting

## Architecture Standards Compliance Gaps

The test harness library (tests/lib/harness.sh) claims BashFX 2.1 compliance but should be updated to BashFX 3.0 standards

Test files use mktemp-based environment setup instead of consistent gitsim + XDG+ temp patterns across all categories

Security tests mix gitsim virtualization with fallback patterns instead of requiring gitsim for full isolation

Test environment setup does not consistently export all required XDG+ environment variables (XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_ETC_HOME, TMPDIR)

The test.sh dispatcher does not validate XDG+ temp directory availability before executing tests

## Test Coverage and Quality Gaps

Integration tests lack proper SCRIPT_DIR path verification which could cause test failures in different environments

Advanced test category exists but has minimal test coverage compared to other categories

Benchmark tests exist but do not report performance metrics or establish performance baselines

Test files do not verify they are running in proper isolated environments before executing potentially destructive operations

Security tests do not validate that environment isolation is actually working (no leakage to real filesystem)

## Tool Integration Gaps

The func tool is documented in KB_TEST_ALIGNMENT.md but not actually integrated into any test validation workflows

The countx tool is documented in KB_TEST_ALIGNMENT.md but not used for tracking test metrics during execution

Test alignment lacks automated function analysis using func ls and func deps for validation

Test execution does not track metrics using countx for test run statistics and historical comparison

## Test Organization and Discovery Gaps

Test categories do not have consistent naming conventions (some use test_ prefix, others do not)

The test.sh dispatcher auto-discovery logic does not handle executable permission validation before attempting to run tests

Test files do not include metadata headers indicating expected duration, dependencies, or isolation requirements

The "all" category execution does not provide category-level isolation or failure containment

## Process Integration Gaps

Test files do not validate syntax before execution using bash -n validation

Test execution does not verify build.sh completion before running tests that depend on built artifacts

Test environment cleanup is handled by individual tests rather than centralized cleanup management

Test failures do not provide actionable error messages or debugging guidance

Test execution does not integrate with project build status or provide pre-commit validation hooks

## Documentation and Standards Gaps

Test files lack inline documentation explaining the purpose and scope of each test function

Test harness functions are not documented with usage examples or parameter specifications

Test category organization rationale is not documented for maintainers

Test execution patterns are not standardized across different test categories (some use functions, others use inline execution)

## Safety and Validation Gaps

Test files do not verify they have required permissions before attempting file operations

Test environment setup does not validate required tools (git, gitsim, etc.) are available before proceeding

Test execution does not provide dry-run or validation modes for safe testing in production environments

Test failures do not distinguish between test logic errors vs environment setup problems

Test execution does not provide rollback or recovery mechanisms for failed test states
