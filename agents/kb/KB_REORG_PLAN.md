# Knowledge Base Reorganization Plan
**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Scope**: agents/ directory cleanup and organization  
**Status**: Analysis phase - pending code review

## Current State Analysis

### File Date Analysis (Aug 28 = Today)
- **CURRENT/ACTIVE** (Aug 28): 15 files including ITERATION.md, observations/, research/
- **RECENT** (Aug 27): 7 files including PILOT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md  
- **PROPERLY ARCHIVED** (Aug 26-27): 8 files already in archive/

### Directory Structure (GOOD)
```
agents/
├── research/        # 11 strategic RX_*.md files (all Aug 28)
├── observations/    # 2 current analysis files (AA, QA)
├── archive/         # 8 historical files (properly organized)
├── scripts/         # Empty, ready for use
└── cache/           # Empty, ready for use
```

## Recommended Actions

### **PRESERVE AS-IS** (High Strategic Value)
- `ITERATION.md` (14:50) - **LIVE** team coordination protocol
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` (Aug 27) - **ESSENTIAL** API specifications  
- `research/RX_*.md` (11 files) - **STRATEGIC ASSETS** - competitive advantages
- `observations/AA_OBSERVATIONS.md` (08:09) - **CURRENT** architecture analysis
- `observations/QA_OBSERVATIONS.md` (08:32) - **CURRENT** quality insights

### **ARCHIVE CANDIDATES** 
1. `SESSION.md` (08:37) - Today's session notes (historical value)
2. `security_analysis.md` (08:01) - Likely superseded by observations
3. `TEST_PLAN_*.md` (2 files) - Test planning records
4. `DEV_TASK_COMPLETE_*.md` (2 files) - Task completion records  
5. `QA_ASSESSMENT_TASK-*.md` (2 files) - Assessment records

### **CRITICAL REVIEW NEEDED**
- `PILOT.md` (Aug 27, 17KB) vs `PILOT_PLANX.md` (Aug 28, 41KB)
  - **Question**: Which is authoritative? Merge or choose one?
- `PLAN.md` (07:21) - May overlap with newer strategic documents

## Dependencies for Final Plan

### **PENDING**: Code Implementation Review
Need to analyze `parts/` directory to understand:
1. **What's actually implemented** vs documented as complete
2. **Task completion accuracy** in task state docs
3. **Documentation gaps** where code exists but isn't documented
4. **Obsolete documentation** where tasks changed but docs didn't update

### **Key Questions for Code Review**
1. Are TASK-001/TASK-002 actually complete per the task docs?
2. What ignition functionality is stub vs implemented?
3. Do the strategic research docs align with current code capabilities?
4. Are there undocumented features or changes?

## Refined Strategy (Post Code Review)

### Phase 1: Implementation State Verification
- [ ] Review parts/ build files for actual implementation
- [ ] Cross-reference with task completion claims
- [ ] Identify documentation-code mismatches

### Phase 2: Documentation Alignment  
- [ ] Update/correct task state docs based on code reality
- [ ] Archive truly obsolete documentation
- [ ] Preserve strategic research that aligns with actual capabilities

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base Optimization
- [ ] Consolidate overlapping documents (PILOT vs PILOT_PLANX)
- [ ] Archive session-specific content
- [ ] Maintain clean current-state documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### **PROTECT STRATEGIC VALUE**
- All `research/RX_*.md` files are future competitive advantages
- Observations contain current architectural insights
- Don't archive anything that influences active development

### **MAINTAIN PROCESS CONTINUITY** 
- ITERATION.md is actively used by the team
- REQUIREMENTS.md is foundational for API development
- Task state accuracy is critical for team coordination

## Next Steps

1. **Code implementation review** - Understand what's actually built
2. **Documentation accuracy audit** - Align docs with code reality  
3. **Execute cleanup plan** - Archive stale content, preserve strategic value
4. **Validate with user** - Confirm plan aligns with project needs
