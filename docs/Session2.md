# Padlock Development - Session 2

## Summary of Work Completed

This session focused on resolving build issues, improving script robustness, adding comprehensive testing, and preparing for future feature development.

### 1. Build Script (`build.sh`)
- **Problem**: The original `build.sh` script had flawed logic for renaming part files, which could lead to incorrect builds or the deletion of valid source files.
- **Solution**: The `rename_from_build_map` function was completely rewritten. The new algorithm is more robust:
    1. It identifies all correctly named files according to `build.map`.
    2. It isolates all other "unprocessed" files.
    3. It renames the unprocessed files based on the numbers in their filenames.
    4. It performs a final cleanup of any true artifacts.

### 2. `.gitsim` Compatibility
- **Problem**: `padlock.sh` and its generated scripts (hooks, wrappers) had a hardcoded dependency on `git`, preventing them from working in `.gitsim` repositories.
- **Solution**:
    - The `_get_repo_root` function was fixed to correctly search parent directories for either a `.git` or `.gitsim` folder.
    - All generated scripts were updated to use a repository-agnostic shell function to find the repo root, removing the dependency on `git rev-parse`.

### 3. Bug Fixes
- **`do_unlock`**: The `unlock` command was fixed to correctly remove the `locker.age` file after a successful decryption.
- **`stderr` Logic**: The logging functions were refactored for clarity, correctness, and to follow a standard logging hierarchy.
- **`readonly` Variable**: A bug causing a "readonly variable" error during the `lock` command was fixed by removing a redundant export from a config template.

### 4. Testing (`test_runner.sh`)
- A new comprehensive test suite, `test_runner.sh`, was created.
- It performs basic smoke tests (`--help`, `version`).
- It runs a full end-to-end test of the `clamp` -> `lock` -> `unlock` workflow.
- It is parameterized to run the end-to-end test against both a real `.git` repository and a simulated `.gitsim` repository, verifying all new functionality.

## Future Concepts

### Checksum Verification
To ensure data integrity against corruption during the encryption/decryption cycle, a checksum verification mechanism should be implemented.
- **Concept**:
    - When `padlock lock` is executed, it will first calculate a deterministic checksum of the `locker/` directory's contents (e.g., using a combination of `find`, `sort`, and `md5sum`).
    - This checksum will be stored as a variable within the generated `.locked` script.
    - When `padlock unlock` (or `source .locked`) is run, it will read the checksum from the script, decrypt the archive, and then re-calculate the checksum of the newly created `locker/` directory.
    - If the checksums do not match, the unlock process will fail with an error, preventing the use of potentially corrupt data.

### Comprehensive `README.md`
A detailed `README.md` is needed to provide a complete guide for users.
- **Content**: The README should include:
    - A clear overview of the "locker pattern" concept.
    - A step-by-step user workflow guide.
    - A complete reference for all commands and their flags (`clamp`, `lock`, `unlock`, `status`, `key`, `install`, `uninstall`).
    - An explanation of the BashFX-compliant file structure (`~/.local/etc/padlock`, etc.).

### Import/Export Functionality
*(Deferred for now)*

To enhance portability and make it easier for users to move their `padlock` environment between systems, an import/export feature could be developed.
- **Concept**: Extend the `padlock key` command with `--export` and `--import` flags.
- **`--export`**:
    - Would gather the central manifest file (`~/.local/etc/padlock/manifest.txt`).
    - Would gather all repository-specific (non-global) private keys stored in `~/.local/etc/padlock/keys/`.
    - It would bundle these files into a single, encrypted, password-protected archive (e.g., `padlock_export.tar.age`).
- **`--import`**:
    - Would prompt for the password to decrypt the `padlock_export.tar.age` archive.
    - It would safely merge the imported manifest with the existing one.
    - It would place the imported keys into the correct `~/.local/etc/padlock/keys/` directory.

This would provide a secure and user-friendly way to back up and restore a `padlock` setup.
