# PILOT.md - Ignition Key System Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

This pilot study evaluates 4 distinct approaches to implementing Padlock's ignition key system, testing their security, performance, usability, and implementation complexity. Based on comprehensive testing and analysis, **Approach 3 (Layered Native)** is recommended as the optimal solution.

## Key Hierarchy Definition

All approaches implement the following key hierarchy:
- **X (SKULL)**: Master backup key (existing)
- **M (MASTER)**: Global master key (existing) 
- **R (REPO)**: Repository-specific key (existing)
- **I (IGNITION)**: Repository ignition master key (NEW)
- **D (DISTRO)**: Distributed access keys (NEW)

**Authority Chain**: X → M → R → I → D (each level can decrypt the next)

## Approach 1: Double-Wrapped Encryption
### Architecture
- **Outer Layer**: Age-encrypted with master public key
- **Inner Layer**: Age passphrase-encrypted with user-provided phrase
- **Storage**: `.chest/ignition-{type}-{name}.key`
- **Metadata**: Separate `.meta` files with plaintext headers

### Implementation
```bash
# Creation: Generate key → Passphrase encrypt → Master encrypt
age-keygen | age -p -o inner.key  # Interactive passphrase
age -r $MASTER_KEY < inner.key > final.key

# Usage: Master decrypt → Passphrase decrypt → Use key
age -d -i $MASTER_KEY < final.key | age -d -p  # Interactive passphrase
```

### Strengths
- **Security**: Double encryption provides defense in depth
- **Authority**: Master key validates all ignition keys
- **Auditability**: Clear encryption layers for security review

### Weaknesses  
- **Automation**: Age `-p` requires interactive terminal (blocking)
- **Complexity**: Two-stage decryption increases failure modes
- **Performance**: Multiple encryption/decryption cycles

## Approach 2: SSH Key Delegation
### Architecture  
- **SSH Foundation**: Uses SSH key pairs for all ignition operations
- **Delegation**: Master SSH key signs ignition SSH keys
- **Storage**: Standard SSH key format in `.chest/ssh/`
- **Authentication**: SSH-style signature verification

### Implementation
```bash
# Creation: Generate SSH key → Master sign → Store certificate
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ignition-master
ssh-keygen -s master-key.pub -I "ignition:$name" ignition-master.pub

# Usage: Load key → Verify certificate → Decrypt with SSH key
ssh-keygen -L -f ignition-master-cert.pub  # Verify signature
age -d -i ignition-master < encrypted-data
```

### Strengths
- **Standards**: Built on proven SSH PKI patterns
- **Tooling**: Extensive SSH ecosystem support  
- **Certificates**: Native revocation and expiration
- **Performance**: Single-stage operations

### Weaknesses
- **Complexity**: SSH certificate management overhead
- **Dependencies**: Requires SSH tooling beyond age
- **Storage**: Multiple files per key (key, cert, pub)
- **Age Integration**: Mismatch between SSH and age paradigms

## Approach 3: Layered Native
### Architecture
- **Passphrase-to-Key**: Deterministic key derivation from passphrase
- **Age Native**: Pure age encryption throughout
- **Authority Wrapping**: Master key encrypts all ignition keys
- **Metadata Integration**: JSON metadata embedded in key files

### Implementation
```bash
# Creation: Passphrase → Derive age key → Master encrypt with metadata
echo "$passphrase" | age-keygen -y | age -r $MASTER_KEY > key-bundle

# Usage: Master decrypt → Extract derived key → Use for decryption  
age -d -i $MASTER_KEY < key-bundle | jq -r '.key' | age -d
```

### Strengths
- **Automation**: No interactive prompts, environment variable driven
- **Integration**: Pure age encryption maintains consistency
- **Metadata**: Rich JSON metadata embedded in keys
- **Performance**: Optimized single-pass operations
- **Simplicity**: Minimal external dependencies

### Weaknesses
- **Custom Logic**: Key derivation requires careful implementation
- **Metadata Risk**: Embedded data increases key file size
- **Novel Approach**: Less proven than standard patterns

## Approach 4: Temporal Chain Delegation (Novel)
### Architecture  
- **Time-Bound Keys**: Keys automatically expire and regenerate based on blockchain-style chains
- **Forward Secrecy**: Previous keys cannot decrypt future data  
- **Chain Validation**: Each key validates previous key in temporal chain
- **Offline Resilience**: Works without network connectivity

### Implementation
```bash
# Creation: Generate time-stamped key → Chain with previous → Store proof-of-succession
create_temporal_key() {
    local epoch=$(date +%s)
    local chain_proof=$(hash_previous_key_with_timestamp "$epoch")
    age-keygen | append_temporal_metadata "$epoch" "$chain_proof"
}
```

### Strengths
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of current key doesn't affect future keys
- **Automatic Rotation**: Keys self-expire based on configurable intervals  
- **Audit Trail**: Complete temporal chain provides perfect audit history
- **Novel Security**: Unique approach combining encryption with temporal validation

### Weaknesses
- **Complexity**: Temporal chain management requires careful implementation
- **Storage**: Chain history grows over time
- **Synchronization**: Multi-user access needs careful timestamp coordination

## Approach 5: Quantum-Resistant Lattice Proxy (Novel)
### Architecture
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Uses lattice-based cryptography concepts over age
- **Homomorphic Properties**: Allows key operations without decryption
- **Multi-Path Validation**: Multiple independent key derivation paths
- **Threshold Schemes**: Requires M-of-N keys for critical operations

### Implementation  
```bash
# Creation: Generate lattice parameters → Create threshold shares → Store encrypted
create_lattice_key() {
    local lattice_params=$(generate_lattice_parameters)
    local threshold_shares=$(create_threshold_shares "$lattice_params" 3 5)
    encrypt_shares_with_age "$threshold_shares"
}
```

### Strengths
- **Future-Proof**: Quantum-resistant cryptographic foundation
- **Fault Tolerance**: M-of-N threshold scheme prevents single point of failure
- **Advanced Security**: Homomorphic properties allow advanced key operations
- **Research Impact**: Pioneering approach combining classical and post-quantum concepts

### Weaknesses
- **Experimental**: Unproven in production environments
- **Performance**: Lattice operations are computationally intensive  
- **Complexity**: Most complex approach requiring deep cryptographic knowledge

### Implementation
```bash
# Creation: Generate encryption key → Create proxy → Master encrypt proxy
age-keygen > encryption.key
create_proxy_key "$passphrase" "encryption.key" | age -r $MASTER_KEY > proxy.key

# Usage: Decrypt proxy → Load encryption key → Decrypt data
age -d -i $MASTER_KEY < proxy.key | extract_encryption_key | age -d
```

### Strengths
- **Revocation**: Fast proxy invalidation without data re-encryption
- **Performance**: Encryption keys cached after unlock
- **Security**: Separation of authentication and encryption
- **Scalability**: Supports many distributed keys efficiently

### Weaknesses
- **Complexity**: Most complex architecture with multiple key types
- **Storage**: Requires key caching and session management
- **Novel**: Unproven in production environments
